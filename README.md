# Overview

This repository contains my dotfiles for various applications and tools that I use across different operating systems. The goal is to provide a consistent and efficient development environment, regardless of the platform.

# Setup/Usage

- Each tool has a `install` script which will put the config where it needs to be for usage. Note that this will override any existing files.
- The `install_all` script will run the `{tool}/install` for all tools relevant to your OS.
- Each tool has a `README.md` which will tell you more about what it does and how to use it
